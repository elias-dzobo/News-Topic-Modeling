# News-Topic-Modeling
This project uses NLP to extract several possible themes from from news headlines

The program preprocesses news headlines and uses a tdidf algorithm as well as a letent Dirichlet allocation technique to extract themes from the headline drawing several news headlines into several possible categries.

This is an unsupervised topic modeling project. 

The program splits the news headlines into two sets using 80% of the data to train our lda model and try to categorize the remaining 20% into 13 different categories.
